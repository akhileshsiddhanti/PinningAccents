{"name":"Pinning Accents: A Study on Accent Classifiers ","tagline":"CS 7641 Machine Learning Project: Akanksha, Akhilesh, Kathan, Sheryl","body":"### Problem Motivation\r\nDue to the recent advancements in the area of speech recognition systems, it has become necessary to recognize the nuances posed by various accents in spoken language. AI-enabled ASR assistants such as Siri and Alexa are unintentionally equipped to perform better with American/British accents, despite being increasingly prevalent in a diverse society. One of the key challenges in automating speech recognition is understanding speech by non-native speakers. Accents can signify a speaker’s ethnic identity, regardless of the context or language being spoken. This project is dedicated to building and evaluating reliable machine learning models that classify accents by identifying the ethnicity of a speaker. Such a classifier has a plethora of real-world applications, allowing for more robust accent-specific speech recognition systems. \\\\\r\n\r\n### Data Description\r\nExplanation of Data \r\n\r\n### Methodology\r\nDescription of models \r\n\r\n### Analysis \r\nSome analysis \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
